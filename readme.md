# Playground

This playground will house my side projects and goofy little experimentsâ€¦ okay, truth be told, this is me trying to work around the limit Google Firebase has on how many projects I can probably have for free, but maybe this won't be necessary. Time & experience will tell.

Essentially, this has become a sort-of monolith with sub-repos. I'm not (currently) using git submodules, but I might if that becomes necessary.
