# Playground

This playground will house my side projects and goofy little experimentsâ€¦ okay, truth be told, this is me trying to work around the limit Google Firebase has on how many projects I can probably have for free, but maybe this won't be necessary. Time & experience will tell.

Essentially, this has become a sort-of monolith with sub-repos. I'm not (currently) using git submodules, but I might if that becomes necessary.

## Firebase Hosting Deployment

`firebase deploy --only hosting`

[Firebase Quickstart Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart)

## Project Structure

Project directories are added to the root and are mostly isolated (sometimes living in their own git repo). Each build/deploy project steps must take whatever final files exist and move them to `../dist` (from the root dir perspective of the projects), i.e. `/playground/dist` (from the playground's perspective). That way, when Firebase hosting deploys, it sends the project up in it's own directory. E.g. `/music-bars` will deploy to `./dist/music-bars`.

**Warning:** be sure to configure the base url, when relevant, to use the right project root like `music-bars` does.
